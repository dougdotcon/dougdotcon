## Scientific Research & Innovation

I am a researcher in **Theoretical Physics** and **Computational Science** currently affiliated with the **Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ)**. My work focuses on the **Architecture of Thermodynamic Emergence (ATE)**, investigating the intersection of information theory and gravitational dynamics.

*   **EntropicGravity-Py:** A computational framework for the numerical validation of Emergent Gravity. Successfully reproduced galactic rotation curves and lensing profiles without Dark Matter particles. **DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18078771**.
*   **Current Research:** Applying "Code-First Physics" to solve cosmological expansion tensions and investigating "Reactive Dark Matter" models.

## Tech Lab & Ventures

*   **Asimovtech Systems** – Founder & CTO. A technology lab focused on Complex Systems, Econophysics, and AI solutions.
*   **Project Sentinel:** Market anomaly detection utilizing Shannon Entropy and Emergent Gravity models to identify structural shifts in digital asset flows.
*   **Flash Compliance:** SaaS framework for atomic swap verification and real-time blockchain auditing.
